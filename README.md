# Labor Costs, Tariffs, and China’s Outward Investment in ASEAN

Repo for research materials, notes, figures, and replication code.

## TL;DR
This project studies how **home-country labor costs** and **destination-country tariffs** jointly shift Chinese manufacturers’ internationalization choices among (i) direct exporting from China, (ii) re-export via ASEAN, and (iii) greenfield FDI in ASEAN. A heterogeneous-firm framework predicts that wage or tariff hikes each reduce the profitability of direct exporting; **when both rise together, the switch toward FDI is super-additive**. We will calibrate the model with firm-level data and test the predictions econometrically.

## Research Questions
1. How do labor costs (China) and tariffs (destination) jointly shape firms’ choices among export / re-export / FDI?
2. Is there a **complementary (super-additive) effect** that accelerates export → FDI switching?
3. How does enforcement risk around rules of origin/anti-circumvention shift the boundary between re-export and local production?
4. Which firm/sector characteristics (ownership, financing constraints, competition, environmental intensity) drive heterogeneity?

## Approach
- **Theory**: Melitz–Helpman–style model comparing unit costs and profits for three modes (Direct Export, Re-export via ASEAN with enforcement risk, and ASEAN FDI). Derive zero-profit cutoffs, mode-switching boundaries, and comparative statics w.r.t. wages, tariffs, and enforcement.
- **Empirics**: (1) Model calibration and counterfactuals; (2) Firm/industry-level regressions linking wages/tariffs/enforcement signals to mode choice; (3) Robustness and heterogeneity analyses.

## Data (planned)
- Chinese manufacturing firm database + customs transactions
- OFDI statistics for ASEAN (by country/industry)
- Tariff schedules and enforcement/ROO signals
- Labor costs: average wages, minimum-wage policies, institutional changes

## Expected Contributions
- Identify a **labor-cost × tariff** super-additive effect on internationalization mode shifts
- Incorporate explicit **enforcement risk** into the payoff of re-export via ASEAN and deliver testable boundary movements
- Provide firm-level evidence for “China + ASEAN” supply-chain reconfiguration
